My name is Madeline and I'm currently a backend developer student at BloomTech. I'm presently working towards graduating from my program and learning the necessary skills to enter the working force as an efficient complex problem-solver. Always eager to learn and grow. Veryu excited to begin my career as a developer in the tech industry :)))))
