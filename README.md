## Howdy howdy ✌🏻

My name is Madeline and I'm currently a backend developer student at BloomTech. I'm presently working on getting graduated from my program and learning the necessary skills to enter the working force as an efficient complex problem-solver. Always eager to learn and grow and very excited to begin my career as a developer in the tech industry 🦋💙

Currently working on:
  * graduating from [BloomTech Institute of Technology](https://www.bloomtech.com/) as a backend developer 👩🏼‍💻
  * slaying my GCA using [CodeSignal](https://app.codesignal.com/) 👑
  * getting all of my homework done and practice in listening to the [best study music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wOAhRAqb40) on planet earth 🍃
